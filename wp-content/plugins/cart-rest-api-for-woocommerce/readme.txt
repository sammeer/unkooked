Adds additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to manage the cart.

== Description ==

WooCommerce REST API is great but it's missing one important endpoint that allows you to manage the cart.

That's were CoCart comes in. It creates requests for the cart the same way Ajax requests are handled allowing you to add, remove, restore and update items to and from the cart.

= Built with Developers in Mind =

CoCart is created for developers in mind and allows you to use WooCommerce's REST API to it's full potential. This also provides the option to create a full app for your WooCommerce store.

Intrigued? _I bet you are._ [See documentation](https://co-cart.github.io/co-cart-docs/) on how to use the API today.

You can also [contribute](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to CoCart.

Enjoy!

If you use CoCart and find it useful for your project and would like to help keep it maintained or just show some appreciation then please [donate](https://www.paypal.me/CodeBreaker).

All contributions are most appreciated and will go towards improving the API and documentation.

== Installation ==

Installing "CoCart" can be done using the following steps:

1. Go to the plugins page of WordPress by clicking 'Add New', search for "CoCart", install and then activate.
2. Alternative Method - Download the plugin from WordPress.org, upload the `cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP or upload the cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce.zip file via the plugin page of WordPress by clicking 'Add New' and selecting the zip from your local computer and then activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I access the cart endpoints? =
All can be explained via the [documentation](https://co-cart.github.io/co-cart-docs/).

= Does it work with any of the official WooCommerce libraries? =
I'm afraid not. This is because the libraries require authentication which the cart does not require.

= Can I view any customers cart? =
No. Only the one in session, just as you would view the cart via the site.
